# Ear classification using different types of neural networks
Assignment #3 for Image Based Biometry @ Faculty of Computer and Information Science at the University of Ljubljana using Tensorflow and Keras.
Different models and methods (mainly data augmentation because of the difficult, small provided dataset) used to classify AWE dataset and classify
images of ears to their identities.
